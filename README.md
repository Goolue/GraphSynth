# GraphSynth
An experiment for a an interactive graph based synth based on the JUCE library. 

I started this as a summer's project to improve my C++ing and to learn more about things like Lookup Table Synthesis and FFT.
The overall architecture of the project is a bit flawed (see TODO list at the bottom).
Anyone can do whatever they want with this, and feel free to mess with the code if you are interested
(just see that you stay within the limits of JUCE's copyrights and such).


TODOs (some of 'em at least):

1) Fix buggy gui on the NodesWithArrows branch / find a better solution to the gui problem
2) comment
3) change node creation to Factory
4) find better solutions to problems marked in the code (the TODOs within the code)
5) add cool animations and stuff to make it look better
6) in general, refactor the s&%^& out of it (switch cases and such)

Thanks for reading this, reading this mathematically proves you are a great person.
